    "1. Base Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - When length == 0, the function returns a list containing one tuple. This is a constant time operation,O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recurrence Relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -  For each recursive call, the function iterates numbers times and makes a recursive call with length - length - 1\n",
    "    -  Therefore, if ùëá(length)T(length) is the time complexity of the function, the recurrence relation is: T(length)=numbers√óT(length‚àí1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "  \n",
    "The overall time complexity can be expressed as: \n",
    "\n",
    "T(length)=numbers^length √óT(0) = numbers^length √óO(1) =O(numbers^length )\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning that this is an algorithm that is exponentially time complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### In relation to evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "- overall producing every single possible answer is very costly. I think you can conclude that human brains don't work that way. so when I solve this puzzle I don't really use information theory\n",
    "\n",
    "- upon furthur thought its the way the algorithm is written. If I can still build every single possible combination of codes without using recursion maybe we still solve it the \"information theory\" way\n",
