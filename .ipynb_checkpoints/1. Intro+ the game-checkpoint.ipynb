    "When I was learning python, I made the game Mastermind. Its only when I tried to write an algorithm to solve it that I realized that there are problems that are combinatorically too large to solve. Or as the number of paramters increase that time it takes so solve them also increases exponentially.\n",

    "I coded a simple version of this in python but in this version there are 6 numbers to choose from and a 4 letter code. You have 12 tries. To explore this combinatorially I want to make the number of number, the length of the code and the number of tries variables. "
